===I am...===

A homeschool mom: I have two kids, Tim, age 13 and Becky, age 11. I've been homeschooling them since Tim was 5 years old.
An aspiring author: See the descriptions of [[Onesimus books|my books]], Free Indeed, hopefully to get published this year, and Faithful unto Death, which I'm still writing.

===Verse of the month===

'''Proverbs 3:11-12'''
''"My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in."''

===Quote of the month===

''"Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint As from beyond the limit of the world, Like the last echo born of a great cry Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice Around a king returning from his wars."''

Tennyson, __Idylls of the King__ on the death of Arthur
